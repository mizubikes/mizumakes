## The Problem

This is how I used to store my wires for soldering - tossed in a plastic container, tangled together, and generally a mess. Not great when you're trying to work efficiently.

I needed a better solution, so I designed and 3D printed one.

## The Solution

I created a simple wire holder that mounts above my soldering station and keeps multiple spools organized and ready to use. The design consists of two main components:

- **End caps** that clamp onto a mounting surface
- **A rod** that holds the wire spools and allows them to spin freely as you pull wire

## Design Process

I drew a couple models in SolidWorks and got right to printing. The design is intentionally simple - two end caps and a rod that holds your wire spools. Everything's designed to print without supports and assemble in minutes.

For my specific setup, I'm mounting it to a crossbar above my soldering station. However, the end caps can be easily customized for any mounting surface - shelves, the wall, or a workbench.

## The Print

I printed these in PLA. Since this lives in my garage workshop and doesn't see high temperatures, PLA works perfectly fine.

The parts were designed to print without supports, making post-processing minimal. End caps came out good, and the rod looks clean too.

## Assembly

Assembly is straightforward:

First, screw one end cap to the rod. Load up your spools. Slide everything onto the mounting rod. Lock the other end cap in place. Clamp both sides down, and you're done.

Total assembly time is just a few minutes.

## In Use

Once installed, you've got organized wire that feeds smoothly right where you need it. The spools spin freely as you pull wire for soldering, and everything stays in place exactly where you mounted it.

It's one of those simple prints that solves a specific problem and makes workshop time more efficient.

## Customization

While this version is designed for my rack system, the beauty of 3D printing is that you can modify the end caps for your specific needs. Whether you want to mount it to a shelf edge, directly to a wall, or clamp it to a workbench, the basic design can be adapted.

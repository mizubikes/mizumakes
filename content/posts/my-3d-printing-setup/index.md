I'm Jared — an engineer who likes to tinker. I mostly print practical stuff: bike parts, things for my kids, fixes around the house, desk organization, and the occasional electromechanical project. Here's what I'm running.

## Printer

**Bambu Lab P1S with AMS**

I've had it for about a year and it's been solid. Coming from the tinkering side of the hobby, the P1S felt almost too easy at first — but I've learned to appreciate just hitting print and having it work.

The AMS makes multi-color prints easy, but honestly I use it more for convenience. I can load up a few rolls and not worry about swapping filament mid-print.

## Nozzles

I have the full set: 0.2mm, 0.4mm, 0.6mm, and 0.8mm.

The **0.6mm** is my go-to. It speeds up prints significantly — 30-40% faster on a lot of models — and unless I really need fine detail, most stuff still looks good. Layer lines are slightly more visible but for functional prints, who cares.

The **0.2mm** comes out for small detailed parts where I need crisp edges. The **0.8mm** is great for big functional prints where strength matters more than looks.

## Filament

I mostly print in PLA, PETG, ASA, and TPU. PLA for quick stuff, PETG for anything that needs to handle heat or stress, ASA for outdoor parts where UV exposure is a factor, and TPU when I need flexibility. I'll get into specific brands in future posts.

## What's Next

I'm documenting projects here and on YouTube at [@MizuMakes3D](https://youtube.com/@MizuMakes3D). More soon.

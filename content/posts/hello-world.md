---

I'm Jared — an engineer who loves to tinker and design things. 3D printing was a natural fit.

I've always been the person who takes things apart to see how they work, then tries to make them better. When I got my first 3D printer, it felt like unlocking a superpower — need a part? Design it. Something broke? Print a replacement. Want to try a weird idea? Prototype it in an hour.

I started this blog to document projects, share what I've learned, and maybe help others who are getting into the hobby. I'll be covering prints, settings, reviews, and the random stuff I make.

## What I Print

Most of my prints are practical:

- **Bike stuff** — I ride and wrench on bikes, so custom mounts, jigs, and replacement parts come up a lot
- **Kid stuff** — toys, fidgets, things that break and need replacing
- **House fixes** — drawer organizers, cable management, replacement knobs and clips
- **Desk organization** — tool holders, trays, anything to keep my workspace usable
- **Electromechanical projects** — I like designing things that move, so 3D printing often combines with motors, servos, and electronics

I'm not really into printing figurines or display pieces. If I'm running the printer, it's usually solving a problem or building something that does something.

## My Setup

**Printer:** Bambu Lab P1S with AMS

I've had it for about a year now and it's been solid. Coming from the tinkering side of the hobby, the P1S felt almost too easy at first — but I've learned to appreciate just hitting print and having it work. The AMS makes multi-color prints easy, but honestly I use it more for convenience. I can load up a few rolls and not worry about swapping filament mid-print.

**Nozzles:** 0.2mm, 0.4mm, 0.6mm, 0.8mm

The stock 0.4mm is fine, but I mostly run the 0.6mm nozzle now. It speeds up prints significantly — we're talking 30-40% faster on a lot of models — and unless I really need fine detail, most stuff still looks good. Layer lines are slightly more visible but for functional prints, who cares.

The 0.2mm comes out for small detailed parts where I need crisp edges. The 0.8mm is great for big functional prints where strength matters more than looks and I just need it done fast.

**Filament**

I'll get into specific brands in future posts, but I mostly print in PLA and PETG. PLA for quick stuff, PETG for anything that needs to handle heat or stress.

## Why MizuMakes

I also have a bike blog called Mizu Bikes — "mizu" is a nod to my last name (Shimizu). MizuMakes is the natural extension for the making/printing side of things.

## What's Next

I'm starting a YouTube channel alongside this blog — [@MizuMakes3D](https://youtube.com/@MizuMakes3D). I'll post videos there and write companion posts here with more detail, print settings, and files when I have them.

If you're into 3D printing, engineering, or just like seeing how things get made, stick around.

More soon.
